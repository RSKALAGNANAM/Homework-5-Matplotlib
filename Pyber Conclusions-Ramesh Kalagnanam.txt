Trends I noticed are as follows:

1. The scatter plot indicates the average fare is higher for "rural" cities than suburban and urban, and the average fare for "suburban" cities is higher than 
that for "urban". This makes rational sense because rural rides may be much longer (distance-wise and time-wise). These riders could be visting cities from their
rural locations. Similarly "suburban" rides also might be longer than "urban" rides but less so than "rural." On the other hand "urban" rides may be several in 
number but shorter in distance. 

2. We see that 2.6 percent of the total drivers are  made 6.8 percent of the Total fares. Similarly, 2.6 percent of the total drivers (rural) accounted 
for 5.3 percent of the total rides. On the surface, this is somewhat surprising and counter-intuitive. It is possible that a sizeable number of people
in the rural areas do not have cars or need to take long trips. This explains the disproportionate portion of the "Total Fares" and "Total Rides".

3. Total rides for "urban" cities are much higher than the other two types. This is reasonable because the trend these days is for people to opt for the 
convenience of taking Uber rather than own a car, especially among younger people.
